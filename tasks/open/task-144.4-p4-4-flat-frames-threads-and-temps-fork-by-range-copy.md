## Description

Plan item P4.4 in `docs/DODMigrationPlan.md` §6 (Phase 4).

Follow `TIGER_STYLE.md` and plan §3: no recursion, explicit limits, ≥ 2 assertions per function, ≤ 70-line functions, snake_case.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Callstack tests ported; fork/pop restores state exactly; every limit returns its named error.
- [ ] Validated by unit tests; `zig build lint` passes on the new code.

## Implementation Notes

Back-of-envelope sketch (plan §3.2, required before writing code): bytes and cache lines touched per operation.
