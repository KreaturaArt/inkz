## Description

Plan item P5.9 in `docs/DODMigrationPlan.md` §6 (Phase 5).

(S7): `RANDOM`, `SEED_RANDOM`, shuffles, and advancing `story_seed`/`previous_random`.

Follow `TIGER_STYLE.md` and plan §3: no recursion, explicit limits, ≥ 2 assertions per function, ≤ 70-line functions, snake_case.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Seeded ground-truth cases produce identical sequences.
- [ ] Validated by unit tests; `zig build lint` passes on the new code.

## Implementation Notes

Back-of-envelope sketch (plan §3.2, required before writing code): bytes and cache lines touched per operation.

## Final Summary
